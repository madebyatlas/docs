# Usage

Wanting to submit a user to the database? This will go over how you're able to use the `/ban request` command to submit a user to the database.

## Using the Command

When using this command it will require 3 parameters; `userid`, `reason`, `evidence`. For the `userid` parameter you will need to paste in a Discord user ID of the user you are reporting (e.g 734511886464188436), this is done by first enabling developer mode in your Discord settings **⚙️ > Advanced > Developer Mode**, and then [right clicking on a user](https://i.imgur.com/vXnTCeB.png) to "Copy User ID". For the `reason` parameter you will need to include a valid reason for submitting the user to the database (e.g DM Advertising, Server Raiding, etc | See [Reasons for Ban Docs](https://docs.madebyatlas.dev/docs/ban-database-bot/usage#reasons-for-ban)), don't make it too long but don't exclude relevant info - put enough to get the point across. For the `evidence` parameter you will need to provide a public link to either a screenshot or screen recording of your reasoning (e.g Audit logs screenshot, Verified Bot Message Logs, etc | See [Uploading Evidence Docs](https://docs.madebyatlas.dev/docs/ban-database-bot/usage#uploading-evidence)).

Once you have all the info inputted you are able to submit the ban request to our team, upon submission it will be sent to the Ban Database Team in the Atlas Development Discord for review. You will recieve a response from the bot notifying you that your submission has been sent and following approval/denial you will recieve a DM from the bot regarding the submission outcome.

### Example Command:
`/ban request userid:734511886464188436 reason:Advertising Spam evidence:https://i.imgur.com/WPgp4Uz.png`
- This would send in a database request for user "734511886464188436" with the reasoning being "Advertising Spam | https://i.imgur.com/WPgp4Uz.png"
