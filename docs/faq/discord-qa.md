# Discord Q/A

### Q: Can I invite my friend to the server?
**A:** Of course! We allow everyone to join the server, just send them one of these invites: [https://discord.gg/atlasdev](https://discord.gg/atlasdev) or [https://discord.gg/kbvMKAG6jh](https://discord.gg/kbvMKAG6jh)

### Q: How do I get my bot in the server?
**A:** As of the start of 2022 we no longer allow Trusted Developers/Boosters to have their bot(s) added to the server.

### Q: I want to apply to be a __________.
**A:** For those interested in being a member of our staff team or applying to be a bot beta tester, please go to our [website](https://madebyatlas.dev/join-our-team) and submit an application!

### Q: Someone sent me an advertisement in DMs, how do I report them?
**A:** Please open a support ticket using `/ticket :open`. Inside the ticket please send the user's ID and a screenshot of your **entire** DM thread with the user.

### Q: Are server bans able to be appealed?
**A:** Bans for certain reasons are able to be appealed. We do not allow appeals for any action that directly violated Rule #1 or Rule #3 in our Discord rules. [Ban Appeal Form](https://madebyatlas.dev/ban-appeal)

### Q: I was assigned the 'Limited' role, what does this mean?
**A:** We have the `Limited` role as another form of moderation related punishment below `Muted`. With the `Limited` role you lose access to be able to change your nickname, you may lose access to `#coding-talk`, you are no longer able to screenshare in voice channels, and you must use Push-to-Talk in voice channels. This role may be on a timed basis and may be removed after a set time or it may stay on you forever.

### Q: Can I have a bot made for me?
**A:** Here at Atlas Development we run on a vouch system. Meaning that we do not make bots for just anyone, you will first need to be vouched for by a `Trusted Developer`, `Server Admin`, `Community Lead`, or a `Atlas Developer`. Please do not DM these people asking for them to vouch for you, you will be banned. Also just because you get vouched for does not mean that a bot will be made for you. Atlas Developers reserve the right to deny any request for a custom bot for **any reason**.
